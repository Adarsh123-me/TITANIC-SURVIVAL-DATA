# TITANIC-SURVIVAL-DATA
Titanic Survival Data Analysis
# Overview
This project focuses on analyzing the survival data of passengers from the RMS Titanic. By examining various factors such as age, gender, class, and more, we aim to understand what influenced the likelihood of survival during the Titanic disaster. This project is implemented in Python and uses various data analysis and visualization libraries.

# Objectives
To perform data cleaning and preprocessing on the Titanic dataset.
To explore and visualize the data to uncover patterns and insights.
To build predictive models to determine the survival probability of passengers based on different features.
To document the entire process, from data exploration to model evaluation.
# Features
Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, converting categorical variables, and normalizing data.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing data distributions, relationships between features, and survival rates.
Feature Engineering: Creating new features from existing data to improve model performance.
Modeling: Building and evaluating machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest.
Visualization: Using libraries like Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly to create insightful visualizations.
# Technologies Used
Python: Core programming language used for the project.
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
NumPy: For numerical computations.
Matplotlib and Seaborn: For data visualization.
Scikit-Learn: For building and evaluating machine learning models.
Jupyter Notebook: For interactive data analysis and documentation.
# Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Titanic dataset provided by Kaggle. It contains information about the passengers on the Titanic, including their survival status, age, gender, passenger class, and more.
